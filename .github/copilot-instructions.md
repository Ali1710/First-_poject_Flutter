This repository is a default Flutter app generated by `flutter create` with minimal customizations.

Key points to help AI coding agents be productive here:

- Project root: `pubspec.yaml` (dependencies and Flutter config). Keep changes minimal and run `flutter pub get` when updating deps.
- App entrypoint: `lib/main.dart`. The app uses MaterialApp and a single stateful home widget (`MyHomePage`). Use this file to see the primary widget tree and state management pattern (setState).
- Tests: `test/widget_test.dart` contains the canonical widget test for the counter app. Use `flutter test` to run tests.
- Lints: `analysis_options.yaml` includes `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`. Prefer following those lint rules; only suppress with `// ignore:` when necessary.

Build & debug workflows (common commands):

- Run on connected device or emulator: `flutter run` (supports hot reload with `r`).
- Build APK: `flutter build apk`.
- Run tests: `flutter test`.
- Static analysis: `flutter analyze`.

Project-specific conventions and patterns:

- Minimal state management: the sample uses setState in a StatefulWidget (`_MyHomePageState`). When adding features, follow the existing pattern unless introducing a new state management solution (document it clearly).
- Keep business logic out of widgets: prefer extracting logic into plain Dart classes or services under `lib/` when it grows beyond trivial UI state.
- File layout: follow the default Flutter structure (platform folders + `lib/`, `test/`, `web/`, `assets` when added).

Integration and external dependencies:

- No third-party packages are currently added besides `cupertino_icons`. If adding packages, update `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`. Verify compatibility with SDK constraint in `pubspec.yaml` (currently `sdk: ^3.9.2`).

Examples from the codebase:

- Entry point and widget pattern: `lib/main.dart` defines `MyApp` -> `MyHomePage` -> `_MyHomePageState` with `_counter` and `_incrementCounter()` using `setState`.
- Test example: `test/widget_test.dart` shows how to pump the `MyApp` widget, assert text values, and simulate taps with `WidgetTester`.

When editing or adding code, run these validation steps locally before committing:

1. `flutter analyze` — check for analyzer/lint errors.
2. `flutter test` — run unit/widget tests.
3. `flutter run` (or `flutter build`) — smoke test the app on a device/emulator.

If you need to change platform-specific configuration, edit files under `android/`, `ios/`, `windows/`, etc. Prefer small, focused changes and include notes in the PR describing platform impacts.

If anything in this file is unclear or you want more detail (e.g., CI commands, code style rules, preferred state management), tell me which area to expand.
